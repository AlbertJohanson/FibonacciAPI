# Fibonacci REST API

The Fibonacci REST API has only one single feature:

- Given an index `n`, the API will reply with the value of the `n` position of the Fibonacci series. Example: if `n=3` response should be `2`, if `n=6` response should be `8`.

## Objective

This repository will be used to versioning the code of the solution but also as a journal or notebook about the process followed to implement the solution.

## Try it locally
